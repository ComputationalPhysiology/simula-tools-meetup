# Simula tools meetup

Roughly every other Monday at 10.00 we meet to discuss software tools and practices.
We typically meet in Nordmark at KA23.

Announcements go out on the `#tools-meetup` channel in the Simula Slack and we try to update the home page at https://computationalphysiology.github.io/simula-tools-meetup

Always feel free to bring a lightning talk!
