## Outline

- What are python type hints
- `mypy` (static type checker)
- Nominal vs structural subtyping
- Abstract base classes vs Protocols
- Overloads
- Generics
- `dataclasses`
- Bonus 1 - `pydantic`
- Bonus 2 - `mypyc`

---

## What is a type?

We can find the type of a variable at runtime using `type`
```python
>>> x = 42
>>> print(type(x))
<class 'int'>
```

We can also check if a variable is of a particular type
```python
>>> isinstance(x, int)
True
>>> isinstance(x, str)
False
```

---


## Built-in types in python

There are several built-in types in python

- Text types: `str`
- Numeric types: `int`, `float`, `complex`
- Sequence Types: `list`, `tuple`, `range`
- Mapping Types:  `dict`
- ...

---

## Python is a dynamically typed language

- Python don't need to know the types at compile time (such as C, C++, Java, Rust)
- But since python 3.5 we can add types to variables

    ```python

    pi: float = 3.142

    def circumference(radius: float) -> float:
        return 2 * pi * radius
    ```

- It was proposed by Guide von Rossum (the creator of python) itself
- [PEP483](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0483) and [PEP484](https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/)
  
---

## Why should you use type annotations?

- You can use a type checker (e.g `mypy`) to catch certain errors without running the code
- It provides documentation
- Good editor support (tab completion and linting)
  
---

## Drawbacks

- It is more code to write
- Sometimes types can be complicated (such as functions, generators)
  - Gradual typing - you don't need to type everything
- Hard to keep backwards compatibility with old python versions

---


## We can use `mypy` to make sure types are correct

Install with `pip`
```
python -m pip install mypy
```

Run `mypy` from the terminal

```
$ mypy file.py
Success: no issues found in 1 source file
```

---


## Annotations for composite types

```python

languages: list[str] = ["python", "julia", "rust"]
version : tuple[int, int] = (3, 10)
options : dict[str, bool] = {"aligned": True, "fixed": False}

```

---

## Annotations for composite types (new)

From python 3.9 and above we can use e.g `list[str]` to annotate a variable as a list of strings.
For python 3.7 and 3.8 you need to add `from __future__ import annotations` to enable this feature.

```python
from __future__ import annotations  # Backport for python3.7 and python3.8

def join(x: list[str], sep: str = ",") -> str:
    return sep.join(x)
```

---

##  Annotations for lists (old)

If you are using python3.6 or older you can use
```python
from typing import List

def join(x: List[str], sep: str = ",") -> str:
    return sep.join(x)
```


(but you should probably consider upgrading)


---

## Optional type

Sometimes you have arguments that are optional

```python
def extract_name_and_capitalize(data: dict[str, str]) -> str | None:
    name = data.get("name")
    if name is None:
        return None
    return name.capitalize()
```

"old" way (before python 3.10)

```python
from typing import Optional

def extract_name_and_capitalize(data: dict[str, str]) -> Optional[str]:
    name = data.get("name")
    if name is None:
        return None
    return name.capitalize()
```

---

## `Optional[str]` is the same as `Union[str, None]`

You can define unions by using either the new way (`|`)

```python
def extract_age(age: str | int) -> int:
    return int(age)
```
or using `Union`

```python
from typing import Union


def extract_age(age: Union[str, int]) -> int:
    return int(age)
```


---

## `Any` can be any type

If you use `Any`, it basically mean that you ignore typechecking 

```python
from typing import Any

a: Any = None
a = []          # OK
a = 2           # OK

s: str = ''
s = a           # OK

def foo(item: Any) -> int:
    # Typechecks; 'item' could be any type,
    # and that type might have a 'bar' method
    item.bar()
    ...
```

---

## Exercise

1. What happens if we run `mypy` on this file?
2. What should be the correct types?

```python
import datetime

class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, year_born):
        self.name = name
        self.year_born = year_born

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"{type(self).__name__}(name={self.name}, year_born={self.year_burn})"

    def age_this_year(self):
        return datetime.datetime.now().year - self.year
```


---

## You can also ask `mypy` to reveal the type

```python
# extract_age.py
def extract_age(age: str | int) -> int:
    return int(age)


age = extract_age("42")
reveal_type(age)
```
```
$ mypy extract_age.py      
extract_age.py:6: note: Revealed type is "builtins.int"
```

---

## What is the problem with this code

```python
def extract_name_and_capitalize(data: dict[str, str]) -> str | None:
    name = data.get("name")
    if name is None:
        return None
    return name.capitalize()


def count_letters_in_names(names: list[str]) -> int:
    return sum(len(name) for name in  names)


data = [
    {"name": "henrik"},
    {"name": "johannes"},
    {"name": "ada"},
]

names = []
for d in data:
    name = extract_name_and_capitalize(d)
    names.append(name)

print(count_letters_in_names(names))
```

---

## A dataclass is a nice way to make classes 

Default methods for `__init__` and `__repr__`

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass, field


@dataclass(kw_only=True)
class Person:
    name: str
    age: int
    email: str | None = field(default=None, repr=False)

person = Person(name="Henrik", age=34)
print(person)  # output: Person(name='Henrik', age=34)
```



---

## Nominal subtyping
The type system supports nominal subtyping. This means that a class `A` is allowed where a class `B` is expected if and only if `A` is a subclass of `B`.
```python
class Base: ...

class Derived(Base): ...

def func1(x: Base): ...

def func2(x: Derived): ...

func1(Base()) # OK
func1(Derived()) # OK - Derived is also Base

func2(Base()) # Not OK - Base is not a subclass of Base
func2(Derived()) # OK
```

---

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from enum import Enum, auto


@dataclass(kw_only=True)
class Person:
    name: str
    age: int
    email: str | None = field(default=None, repr=False)


class Grade(Enum):
    A = auto()
    B = auto()
    C = auto()
    D = auto()
    E = auto()
    F = auto()


@dataclass
class Student(Person):
    average_grade: Grade


def print_name(person: Person) -> None:
    print(person.name)


def print_average_grade(student: Student) -> None:
    print(student.average_grade)


print_name(Person(name="Henrik", age=34))  # OK
print_name(Student(name="Henrik", age=34, average_grade=Grade.B))  # OK
print_average_grade(Person(name="Henrik", age=34))  # Fails
print_average_grade(Student(name="Henrik", age=34, average_grade=Grade.B))  # OK

```

---

## Structural subtyping (duck typing)

*"If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck"*

---

```python
# duck.py

class Duck:
    def quack(self):
        print("Quack")


class Dog:
    def quack(self):
        print("Woff")


def say_quack(duck: Duck) -> None:
    duck.quack()


say_quack(Duck())
say_quack(Dog())
```

---

## Abstract base classes (inheritance) - nominal subtyping

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod


class Quackable(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def quack(self): ...


class Duck(Quackable):
    def quack(self):
        print("Quack")


class Dog(Quackable):
    def quack(self):
        print("Woff")


def say_quack(duck: Quackable) -> None:
    duck.quack()


say_quack(Duck())
say_quack(Dog())
```

---


## Protocol (implementation interface) - structural subtyping

```python
from typing import Protocol


class Quackable(Protocol):
    def quack(self): ...


class Duck:
    def quack(self):
        print("Quack")


class Dog:
    def quack(self):
        print("Woff")


def say_quack(duck: Quackable) -> None:
    duck.quack()


say_quack(Duck())
say_quack(Dog())

```

---

## Abstract base classes vs Protocols

- Abstract base classes provides runtime checks
  - You cannot inherit from an abstract base class without implementing all abstract methods
- Inheritance introduces strong coupling
- Several interfaces requires multiple inheritance which is complicated
- If you have several classes in many files, then all need to import the abstract base class in all files in order to inherit from them
- Protocols can be defined where they are used

---

## `overload` - Return type depends on argument types

```python
# add_two.py
def add_two(x: float | int) -> float | int:
    return x + 2
```

Return type here will always by a union of `float` and `int`

```python
x: int = 2
y = add_two(x)
reveal_type(y)
```

---

We can use `@overload` to tell what the return type is for a given input type

```python
from typing import overload


@overload
def add_two(x: int) -> int:
    ...


@overload
def add_two(x: float) -> float:
    ...


def add_two(x: float | int) -> float | int:
    return x + 2

x: int = 2
y = add_two(x)
reveal_type(y)
```

---

## Generics

A generic function takes a list of "something" and returns "something"

```python
from typing import TypeVar

T = TypeVar("T")


def first(lst: list[T]) -> T:
    """Returns the first argument of the list"""
    return lst[0]


x: list[int] = [1, 2, 3]
reveal_type(first(x)) # Revealed type is "builtins.int*"

y: list[str] = ["1", "2", "3"]
reveal_type(first(y)) # Revealed type is "builtins.str*"

# asterisk means that type is inferred
```

---

## Key takeaways

- Running a static type checker can potentially catch bugs that are normally only caught by very specialized unit tests, e.g checks that a compiler normally would check, for example check that `None` is handled.
- Adding types makes you think more about design (IMO).
- Types provides good documentation
- Modern editors have extensions that can use types to provide better auto completion

---

## Bonus - `pydantic` (enhanced dataclasses)

- `pydantic` is a tool that uses type annotations to convert data to the correct format and validate input data at runtime
- This is greats when working with json data where strings for example should be interpreted as numbers
- `pydantic` is one of the core components of `fastapi`
- `pip install pydantic`
- https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io
 

---

## Converts strings to numbers

```python
from datetime import datetime
from typing import List, Optional
from pydantic import BaseModel


class User(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name = 'John Doe'
    signup_ts: Optional[datetime] = None
    friends: List[int] = []


external_data = {
    'id': '123',
    'signup_ts': '2019-06-01 12:22',
    'friends': [1, 2, '3'],
}
user = User(**external_data)
print(user.id)
#> 123
print(repr(user.signup_ts))
#> datetime.datetime(2019, 6, 1, 12, 22)
print(user.friends)
#> [1, 2, 3]
print(user.dict())
"""
{
    'id': 123,
    'signup_ts': datetime.datetime(2019, 6, 1, 12, 22),
    'friends': [1, 2, 3],
    'name': 'John Doe',
}
"""
```

---

## Raises ValidationError if provided data 

```python
from pydantic import ValidationError

try:
    User(signup_ts='broken', friends=[1, 2, 'not number'])
except ValidationError as e:
    print(e.json())

# Output: 
# [
#   {
#     "loc": [
#       "id"
#     ],
#     "msg": "field required",
#     "type": "value_error.missing"
#   },
#   {
#     "loc": [
#       "signup_ts"
#     ],
#     "msg": "invalid datetime format",
#     "type": "value_error.datetime"
#   },
#   {
#     "loc": [
#       "friends",
#       2
#     ],
#     "msg": "value is not a valid integer",
#     "type": "type_error.integer"
#   }
# ]
```
---

## Extra Bonus - `mypyc`

`mypyc` compiles python modules to C extensions and uses type hints to generate fast code

```python
# fib.py

import time


def fib(n: int) -> int:
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fib(n - 2) + fib(n - 1)


t0 = time.perf_counter()
fib(32)
print(time.perf_counter() - t0)
```

---

Try running the code
```
python -c "import fib"
```

Now compile the code with `mypyc` and run it again
```
mypyc fib.py
python -c "import fib"
```

<https://mypyc.readthedocs.io/>

---

```
python -m pydoc typing
```
